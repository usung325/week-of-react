## Throughout the Week

Continually ask yourself:
- How do these concepts apply to real-world scenarios?
- How can you combine different patterns and techniques in your project?
- What are the trade-offs and best use cases for each concept you've learned?

---

Remember to be flexible with the time allocations - some tasks might take more or less time depending on your prior experience and learning pace. The goal is to understand and apply each concept thoroughly.

Good luck with your React learning journey!
